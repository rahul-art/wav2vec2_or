Soon after the superior performance of Wav2Vec2 was demonstrated on the English ASR dataset LibriSpeech, *Facebook AI* presented XLSR-Wav2Vec2 (click [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13979)). XLSR stands for *cross-lingual  speech representations* and refers to XLSR-Wav2Vec2`s ability to learn speech representations that are useful across multiple languages.\n\nSimilar to Wav2Vec2, XLSR-Wav2Vec2 learns powerful speech representations from hundreds of thousands of hours of speech in more than 50 languages of unlabeled speech. Similar, to [BERT's masked language modeling](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/), the model learns contextualized speech representations by randomly masking feature vectors before passing them to a transformer network.\n\n![wav2vec2_structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/xlsr_wav2vec2.png)\n\nThe authors show for the first time that massively pretraining an ASR model on cross-lingual unlabeled speech data, followed by language-specific fine-tuning on very little labeled data achieves state-of-the-art results.

This might be a wrong assumption though.\n\nOne should always keep in mind that the data-preprocessing is a very important step before training your model. E.g., we don't want our model to differentiate between `a` and `A` just because we forgot to normalize the data. The difference between `a` and `A` does not depend on the \"sound\" of the letter at all, but more on grammatical rules - *e.g.* use a capitalized letter at the beginning of the sentence. So it is sensible to remove the difference between capitalized and non-capitalized letters so that the model has an easier time learning to transcribe speech. \n\nIt is always advantageous to get help from a native speaker of the language you would like to transcribe to verify whether the assumptions you made are sensible, *e.g.* I should have made sure that keeping `'`, but removing other special characters is a sensible choice for Turkish.

The same speech signals sampled at two different rates have a very different distribution, *e.g.*, doubling the sampling rate results in data points being twice as long.

In contrast to most NLP models, XLSR-Wav2Vec2 has a much larger input length than output length. *E.g.*, a sample of input length 50000 has an output length of no more than 100. Given the large input sizes, it is much more efficient to pad the training batches dynamically meaning that all training samples should only be padded to the longest sample in their batch and not the overall longest sample. Therefore, fine-tuning XLSR-Wav2Vec2 requires a special padding data collator, which we will define below\n\n- Evaluation metric. During training, the model should be evaluated on the word error rate. We should define a `compute_metrics` function accordingly\n\n- Load a pretrained checkpoint. We need to load a pretrained checkpoint and configure it correctly for training.\n\n- Define the training configuration.\n\nAfter having fine-tuned the model, we will correctly evaluate it on the test data and verify that it has indeed learned to correctly transcribe speech."},{"metadata":{"id":"Slk403unUS91"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Set-up Trainer\n\nLet's start by defining the data collator.

This is necessary because in speech input and output are of different modalities meaning that they should not be treated by the same padding function.\nAnalogous to the common data collators, the padding tokens in the labels with `-100` so that those tokens are **not** taken into account when computing the loss."},{"metadata":{"id":"tborvC9hx88e","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataCollatorCTCWithPadding:\n    \"\"\"\n    Data collator that will dynamically pad the inputs received.\n    Args:\n        processor (:class:`~transformers.Wav2Vec2Processor`)\n            The processor used for proccessing the data.\n        padding (:obj:`bool`, :obj:`str` or :class:`~transformers.tokenization_utils_base.PaddingStrategy`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`True`):\n            Select a strategy to pad the returned sequences (according to the model's padding side and padding index)\n            among:\n            * :obj:`True` or :obj:`'longest'`: Pad to the longest sequence in the batch (or no padding if only a single\n              sequence if provided).\n            * :obj:`'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument :obj:`max_length` or to the\n              maximum acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.\n            * :obj:`False` or :obj:`'do_not_pad'` (default): No padding (i.e., can output a batch with sequences of\n              different lengths).\n        max_length (:obj:`int`, `optional`):\n            Maximum length of the ``input_values`` of the returned list and optionally padding length (see above).\n        max_length_labels (:obj:`int`, `optional`):\n            Maximum length of the ``labels`` returned list and optionally padding length (see above).\n        pad_to_multiple_of (:obj:`int`, `optional`):\n            If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value.\n            This is especially useful to enable the use of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware with compute capability >=\n            7.5 (Volta).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    processor: Wav2Vec2Processor\n    padding: Union[bool, str] = True\n    max_length: Optional[int] = None\n    max_length_labels: Optional[int] = None\n    pad_to_multiple_of: Optional[int] = None\n    pad_to_multiple_of_labels: Optional[int] = None\n\n    def __call__(self, features: List[Dict[str, Union[List[int], torch.Tensor]]]) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:\n        # split inputs and labels since they have to be of different lenghts and need\n        # different padding methods\n        input_features = [{\"input_values\": feature[\"input_values\"]} for feature in features]\n        label_features = [{\"input_ids\": feature[\"labels\"]} for feature in features]\n\n        batch = self.processor.pad(\n            input_features,\n            padding=self.padding,\n            max_length=self.max_length,\n            pad_to_multiple_of=self.pad_to_multiple_of,\n            return_tensors=\"pt\",\n        )\n        with self.processor.as_target_processor():\n            labels_batch = self.processor.pad(\n                label_features,\n                padding=self.padding,\n                max_length=self.max_length_labels,\n                pad_to_multiple_of=self.pad_to_multiple_of_labels,\n                return_tensors=\"pt\",\n            )\n\n        # replace padding with -100 to ignore loss correctly\n        labels = labels_batch[\"input_ids\"].masked_fill(labels_batch.attention_mask.ne(1), -100)\n\n        batch[\"labels\"] = labels\n\n        return batch","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"lbQf5GuZyQ4_","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_collator = DataCollatorCTCWithPadding(processor=processor, padding=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"xO-Zdj-5cxXp"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Next, the evaluation metric is defined.
